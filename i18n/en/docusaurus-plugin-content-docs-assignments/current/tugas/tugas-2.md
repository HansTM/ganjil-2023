# Assignment 2: Introduction to Django and Models View Template (MVT) Concept

Platform-Based Programming (CSGE602022) - Organized by the Faculty of Computer Science Universitas Indonesia, Odd Term 2022/2023

---

## Task Descriptions

In this assignment, you will implement the Model-View-Template concept on Django and also some of the implementation that you've learned in the tutorial session. You can accomplish this assignment by using [this source code repository](https://github.com/pbp-fasilkom-ui/tugas-lab-repository). For this assignment, you are asked to:

1. Create a function on `views.py` that can do querying into models and returns the data into a HTML.
2. Create a routing to map the function that you've created in `views.py`.
3. Map the data that has been returned into HTML by using Django syntax for templates and data mapping.
4. Deploy your assignment into Heroku so that your friends and your teaching assistants can access it via the Internet.
5. Create a README.md containing a hyperlink to your Heroku application and also answers the following questions:
    - Create a diagram containing client request to the Django web application and its response. Also explain the flow of the diagram and how the `urls.py`, `views.py`, `models.py` and HTML files connected each other.
    - Explain why do we use virtual environments? Let's say, if we do not use the virtual environments, can we still create a Django web application? 
    - Explain how did you implement the steps on point 1 to point 4 above.

Please keep in mind that you need either **create new repository or use different repository** from your tutorial repository.

## Deadlines

The deadline of this task is set on September 15th 2022 at 12PM. Please submit the repository link of your assignments on the submission slot in SCELE.

## Bonus

You will gain bonus for the grading if you're able to implement and demonstrate basic testing (e.g. unit testing, functional testing) on your assignments.
